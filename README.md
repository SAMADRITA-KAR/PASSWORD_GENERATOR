## Dependencies

The script requires Python 3.x to run.

## Usage

To generate a random password, run the `password_generator.py` script and follow the instructions:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the desired length for your password. After entering the length, the script will generate a random password that satisfies the specified constraints.

## Constraints

The generated password will always contain a mix of the following character types:

- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*())
- The password will be generated with the constraint that it must include at least one character from each of the four character types to enhance security.

## Example
Suppose you want to generate a password with a length of 12 characters. Upon running the script, you will see the following prompt:

```bash
How many characters should your password have? 12
```

After entering the desired length (12 in this case), the script will generate a random password that satisfies the constraints. For example:

```bash
Your password is: Pa$5wDz7@!2R
```
